=> 4070-1.0.7

The following **default** server configurations were removed:
- javascript-typescript-langserver: use the LSP-typescript helper package
- typescript-language-server: inferior alternative
- lsp-tsserver: inferior alternative
- intelephense-ls: use the LSP-intelephense helper package
- phpls: no longer maintained
- cquery: no longer maintained
- bashls: use the LSP-bash helper package
- rls: use the rust-analyzer instead
- eslint: use the LSP-eslint helper package

More generally, the idea is to move towards more helper packages.
Experience shows it takes more than a few lines of JSON config to get a
good language server experience for some servers.
